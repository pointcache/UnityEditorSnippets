## Editor

* **Collapse Project hotkey** - collapses all contents of the project window 
* **Collapse Hierarchy hotkey** - collapses hierarchy (scenes become uncollapsed, whoever works with multiscene fix this)
* **Create folder for selected** - will create a folder with the same name for selected asset in project window (found in context menu)

*Tip - if you collapsed but still have object selected, hover over hierarchy and press F - it will select and expand hierarchy to currently selected object.*

## GameObject (found in gameobject context menu)
* **Create Parent** - creates parent for the selected gameobject in scene.
* **Make first child** - moves to the top of hierarchy under current parent
* **Make last child** - moves to the bottom of hierarchy under current parent
* **Move up one level** - parents to the parent of the parent.
* **Move up** - move up one position in hierarchy under same parent.
* **Move down** - move down one position in hierarchy under same parent.

## Component (found in component context menu - gear icon)
* **Move to top** - moves the component to the top
* **Move to bottom** - moves the component to the bottom
